# Workers and Resources Production Calculator

Production Calculator for the game Workers and Resources: Soviet Republic programmed in C.

Honestly, I don't even know if this program is correct, but I hope it is lol

## Build project

### Linux

1. Install GCC, make and GTK 3 (Ã¬f you don't have them)
2. Clone this repository into a directory using Git
3. Run `make` in the repository directory. The build results will be contained within `bin` subdirectory.
4. Move `soviet-calc` and `gui` directory to wherever you want (**They should be together in the same place!**)
5. Run `./soviet-calc` to check the built program
6. Run `make clean` if you want to clean up the built exectables from the `bin` subdirectory

### Windows

Despite the game is natively provided only for Windows, the build process is meant for Linux,
so you need a Linux-like environment in order to successfully build it.
You can build this project for Windows using one of these options:

* cross-compilation from Linux or [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
with [MinGW-w64](https://www.mingw-w64.org/)
* native compilation with MinGW-w64 using [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/)

The latter way is strongly recommended as you only need to install the necessary packages
in MSYS to build the project from Windows. Linux/WSL users would probably need some
[more preparations](https://discourse.gnome.org/t/desperately-need-help-with-mingw64-and-gtk-3-0-for-cross-compilation-from-linux-wsl-ubuntu-to-windows/15150/7)
to make the project buildable with cross-complation.

The following Linux/MSYS packages are required in order to build this project for Windows:

* make
* mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc
* mingw-w64-x86_64-gtk3
* mingw-w64-x86_64-pkg-config

Just run launch your Linux/MSYS terminal and follow the instructions from the "Linux" subsection.

## How to run it

To run it, compile it with GCC and run the executable. There's a build script which you can modify for your own uses.

You can also just download it from the releases tab, but I wouldn't recommend it because I pretend to change it all the time, and I don't really know much about releases on GitHub.

## License

The code is free and open source. You can download it, run it, modify it and redistribute it (GPLv3). Just credit me if you make a fork, ok?

## Stuff I haven't done yet

Right now basically everything works. You can calculate every factory's production line from top to bottom. The next thing is to put vehicle production chains. I also want to calculate if the production chain is enough for the amount of workers it requires (e.g. if food production sustains the workers it requires and if there's anything remaining, as well as how many remaining workers that food factory can feed).

## Program usage

1. Choose a resource you want to produce and number of factories you want to build for it.
2. Click button "Calculate".
3. Number of factories and workers required to build up the production chain will be displayed in the below table.
